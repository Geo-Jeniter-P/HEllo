            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a full stack developer with a passion for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. I have experience in various technologies and frameworks, allowing me to build robust solutions that meet user needs.
                Morning hours are usually dedicated to tackling complex tasks that require deep concentration, such as coding, debugging, and optimizing code.
                Full stack developers work on both the front end and back end of web development, which includes crafting user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and managing server-side logic with languages like Python or Node.js.
                In the afternoon, I often shift my focus to collaboration and communication, engaging with team members, attending meetings, and reviewing code. This time is also used for testing and deploying applications, ensuring that everything runs smoothly before going live.
